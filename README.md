## About me

My name is Nolan Cyr and I'm from New York City. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at The University of Vermont. What I enjoy most about programming is that it allows us to take a difficult or complicated problem and simplify it into a logical and elegant solution. Additionally, I have a strong interest in mathematics and love discovering the connections between math and computer science, and how they complement one another in problem solving.
